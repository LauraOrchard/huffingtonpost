<h3>Persona #1: Math Nerd</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Math Nerd can be either male or female, but the ages between the two genders will probably be
				different.
				</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The male Math Nerd will most likely be between 12 and 35, still living at home while attending high
					school, college, graduate school, and eventually their doctoral studies in the fields of pure math, chemistry, engineering, and physics, with a minor
					in classical scoring for piano and oboe. With a close circle of other scientists and musicians, he will
					want to re-post this piece to all of his friends, challenging them to compete in solving the problem without looking at
					the proposed solution and rendering their answer in the key of A minor. The male Math Nerd will be using a mobile device or a desktop that
				shares his gaming equipment.
				<li>Female Math Nerds, although a smaller segment of the demographic, will most likely be between the ages of 8 and 25, having metriculated from their STEM programs
				and post-doctoral studies early. Whether she's gathering challenge questions to determine who plays first
					in her 3D rendered Kal-toh game, or preparing for her next class agenda, she will forward this piece to herself at her .edu address with a reminder
					to use it later. She'll also use it as an interview question to select her
					interns. The female Math Nerd will be using a tablet exclusively.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The goal for both genders when reading the Huffington Post's "Cheryl's Birthday Math Problem" is to quickly glean
			from the article:
				<ul>
					<li>whether they've seen the challenge before,</li>
					<li>the level of the challenge, and</li>
					<li>whether it merits a comment from them in the comments section.</li>
				</ul>
			If they decide it will be of interest to either their math friends or their students, it is imperative that all of
			the external links and media links work seamlessly so they can re-post or forward it.<br />
			<br />
			A secondary goal will be to prove their superiority by posting a criticism of the challenge, the writer, the
			elements of the math problem, the previous commentor, or the color of the sky. The ability to easily comment will
			effect their willingness to wrestle it out with the other nerds.
			</p>

			<h3>Persona #2: Blogger</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Age: between 12 and 55.</li>
				<li>Goal: to easily locate and access both entertaining and informative articles that can be included as a link from their blog post.</li>
				<li>Technology: both tablet and desktop.</li>
			</ol>
